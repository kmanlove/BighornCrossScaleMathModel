Introduction
---

Host immune response to pathogens can have major impacts on host health. Aggressive responses to pathogen colonization ("resistance") increase both the risks on the host's own cells ("immunopathology"), and the likelihood of disease-induced mortality. Additionally, immune responses like coughing and nasal secretions may facilitate pathogen transmission. However, most models linking within- and between-host pathogen dynamics overlook host immune responses and focus instead on pathogen population size ("parisitemia") as the sole driver of transmission and disease-induced mortality. General descriptions of how parisitemia and immunopathology interact to impact host population-level disease processes like prevalence, persistence time, and epidemic size are rare. 

Purpose and Hypotheses 
---
We use a mathematical model to address the question, **"How do host defense efficacy, host defense damage, and pathogen damage scale to shape pathogen persistence time and prevalence at the host population level?"** Purpose (1) of this model is to articulate cross-scale relationships linking within-host immune defenses, immune damages, and pathogen damages to pathogen persistence, prevalence, and disease burden at the host population level. Purpose (2) is to describe the how different functional relationships between within-host immune defenses, damages, and pathogen population damages shape host population-level disease properties. Purpose (3) is to describe the sensitivity of other model parameters in the presence of particular relationships between immune response, transmission, and pathology. Specifically, we hypothesize the following:

- **Hypothesis 1:** $R_{0}$ (number of new infections produced by a single infected individual in an otherwise fully susceptible population) and the critical community size required for pathogen persistence depend on within-host relationships between immune response and pathogen population size.

- **Hypothesis 2:** The system is most sensitive to between-host contact processes ($\beta$) in settings where transmission is driven by immunopathology and mortality is driven by pathogen-induced pathology.

#### Entities, state variables, and scales

The model consists of four compartments, two within-host and two between-host. At the within-host level, the compartments are the pathogen population size ("L") and the host immune defense ("D"). At the between-host level, the compartments consist of susceptible ("X") and infected ("Y") hosts. The within-host and population-level models operate on different time scales. Within-host processes depend on $\tau$, the time since infection. Between-host processes depend on $t$, the time since pathogen introduction into the host population. 

#### Process overview, scheduling, and initial conditions

At the between-host level, hosts move from susceptible to infected along a population-level timescale, $t$. The infectious state, $Y$, is subject to a second timescale, $\tau$, denoting time since infection. Within-host dynamics initiate when a host moves from $X$ to $Y$, so that $\tau = 0$ is the moment of infection for a given host (at which time L = 1 and D = 0). By definition, $\tau$ must be less than $t$ for all $Y(t, \tau)$. The model starts when the first parasite colonizes the first host, so $Y(0, 0) = 1$, $L(0, 0) = 1$, and $D(0, 0)$ = 0. 

##### Within-host pathogen process
We use a Holling Type III functional response to link the pathogen population size ($L(\tau)$) and the size of the host's immune defense ($D(\tau)$) at time $\tau$. Three parameters, $\nu$, $\psi$, and $\phi$, control the speed and asymptote of the functional response. 

$$\frac{dL(\tau)}{d\tau} = \rho L(\tau) - \frac{\nu L(\tau)^{2}D(\tau)}{\psi^{2} + L(\tau)^{2}}$$

$$\frac{dD(\tau)}{d\tau} = D(\tau)\frac{\phi\nu L(\tau)^{2}}{\psi^{2} + L(\tau)^{2}} - \epsilon D(\tau)$$

##### Between-host process
Hosts transition from susceptible (X) to infected (Y) as a function of the ``force of infection'' ($\lambda(t)$), which incorporates X, Y, and a between-host contact process, $\beta$. Hosts are born into X at rate $\theta(t)$, and removed from X and Y by a natural mortality process, $\mu(t)$. Hosts in Y are subject to an additional disease-induced mortality risk, $\alpha(t)$. While Y is classically treated as homogeneous (e.g., all hosts in Y contribute equally to $\lambda(t)$), here an individual host's contribution to $\lambda(t)$ and their disease-induced mortality risk ($\alpha(t)$) are functions of their within-host pathogen and immune dynamics, which in turn depend on time since infection:

$$\frac{d(X(t))}{dt} = \theta(t)\left(X(t) + Y(t)\right) - \left(\lambda(t) + \mu(t) \right)X(t)$$
$$\frac{\partial Y(t, \tau)}{\partial\tau} + \frac{\partial Y(t, \tau)}{\partial t} = X(t)\lambda(t) - \left(\mu(t) + \alpha(t))\right)Y(t, \tau)$$


##### Cross-scale relationships ($\lambda(t)$ and $\alpha(t)$)
$\lambda(t)$ governs the transition from $X$ to $Y$. This transition rate depends on the pathogen population size aggregated over all infected hosts at time $t$, dependent upon where each host is at in its own personal infection process (e.g., each host's $\tau$ at time $t$). $\lambda(t)$ can be written:

$$\lambda(t) = \beta\int_{0}^{t}Y(t,\tau)f_{1}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) d\tau $$

$\alpha(t)$ depends on the prevalence and severity of infection throughout the population as a whole at time $t$, as described by pathogen load/immune-defense relationship $f_{2}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right)$ such that

$$\alpha(t) = \int_{0}^{t}f_{2}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right)d\tau$$

##### Structures of $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$

For the force of infection relationship, $f_{1}$, we consider three simple cases. In case (a) $\lambda(t)$ depends entirely on pathogen population size. In (b) $\lambda(t)$ is mitigated by the host's immune response. In (c) $\lambda(t)$ is enhanced by the host's immune response. Formally, 
$$\text{(a) } f_{1}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto L(\tau),$$
$$\text{(b) }f_{1}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto L(\tau) - L(\tau) \times D(\tau),$$
$$\text{(c) }f_{1}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto L(\tau) + L(\tau) \times D(\tau)$$

For the disease-induced mortality relationship, $f_{2}$, we consider two extreme cases, (d) where $\alpha(t)$ is entirely driven by parisitemia, (e) where $\alpha(t)$ is entirely driven by immunopathology, and a third intermediate case, (f), where paristemia and immunopathology contribute equally. In summary,

$$\text{(d) } f_{2}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto L(\tau),$$
$$\text{(e) }f_{2}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto D(\tau),$$
$$\text{(f) }f_{2}\left(L(\tau), D(\tau)\right) \propto L(\tau) + D(\tau)$$
